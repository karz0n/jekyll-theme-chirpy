**Link Time Optimization** (LTO) gives GCC the capability of dumping its internal representation (GIMPLE) to disk, so that all the different compilation units that make up a single executable can be optimized as a single module. This expands the scope of inter-procedural optimizations to encompass the whole program (or, rather, everything that is visible at link time).

Link Time Optimization does not need to use any special linker features. The basic mechanism needed is the detection of GIMPLE sections inside object files. This is currently implemented in collect2. Therefore, LTO will work on any linker already supported by GCC.

Example of using:
```bash
$ gcc -flto -c file1.c
$ gcc -flto -c file2.c
$ gcc -flto -o f file1.o file2.o
```

The most suitable way to use LTO is using it by [CheckIPOSupported](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/CheckIPOSupported.html) CMake module. The example of using can be seeing at [EnableLTO.cmake](https://github.com/karz0n/warehouse/blob/master/cmake/modules/EnableLTO.cmake).
